# Address_Book

This App is written in Java.<br/>
I used the Java Extension on Visual Studio Code.<br/>
You will also need the JavaFX Extension as well if you are using this method. <br/>
This link will take you to the Java extension: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial <br/>
This link will take you to the JavaFX extention https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-gui <br/>
Download the zip and extract the file.<br/>
Open the go onto VSCode and open the addbook folder as the project.<br/>
click on the App.java file and this should run the program.<br/>
